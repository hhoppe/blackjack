# # Blackjack game probabilistic analysis
#
# [Hugues Hoppe](https://hhoppe.com/) &emsp; first version in March 2022
# &emsp;
# [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/hhoppe/blackjack/blob/main/blackjack.ipynb)
#
# (I was taking a reinforcement learning course which considered a simplified version of the blackjack game &mdash; *&ldquo;the most widely played casino banking game in the world&rdquo;* &mdash; this became a side project.)
#
# **Goals**:
#
# - Probabilistic analysis of
# [blackjack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackjack) actions and outcomes
# (without Monte Carlo simulation).
#
# - Support for many rule variations, including:
#   - Number of decks (1, 2, 4, 6, 8, infinite shoe)
#   - Blackjack payout (e.g. 3:2, 6:5, 1:1)
#   - Dealer stand/hit on soft total of 17
#   - Loss of original bet or all bets to a dealer's blackjack.
#   - Double on any two cards or with mininum total
#   - Double after splitting (either any card or non-ace)
#   - Resplit to any number of hands
#   - Repslit aces
#
# - Optimal-action tables for [basic strategy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackjack#Basic_strategy) under any rules.
#
# - Composition-dependent strategy (considering not just player total but individual card values).
#
# - Computation of house edge under any rules, with either basic or composition-dependent strategy.
#
# - Reproduction of the
# [basic strategy tables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackjack#Basic_strategy) and
# [house edge results](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackjack#Rule_variations_and_effects_on_house_edge)
# listed in online sources.

# ## Notes
#
# - The term blackjack (abbreviated `bj`) refers to a natural (Ace, 10) hand
# and not to any set of cards whose total is 21.

# %% [markdown]
# **TODO**:
#
# - Run a simulation to precisely verify the negative house edge
#    for `Rules(num_decks=1, stand_soft17=True)`.

# ## Define `Rules`
#
# The `Rules` class below captures the many
# [variations in blackjack rules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackjack#Rule_variations_and_effects_on_house_edge).
#
# The class fields default to values used in
# the [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackjack).
#
# Another useful reference is a
# [comparison of Las Vegas casinos](https://wizardofvegas.com/guides/blackjack-survey/)
# which uses the base rules:
# - BJ pays 3:2;
# - one bet lost to a dealerâ€™s BJ;
# - you may double down on any two cards but not after splitting;
# - you may split any pair;
# - you may resplit any pair except aces to make up to four hands;
# - split aces receive one card each;
# - insurance;
# - no surrender.
#
# Those base rules correspond to
# `Rules(double_after_split=False, late_surrender=False)`.
#
# Their table of casinos (171 rows) lists common rule variations:
# - "s17": (`stand_soft17=True`): 28 out of 171 (opposite of "h17").
# - "ds": (`double_after_split=True`): 148 out of 171 (very frequent).
# - "ls": (`late_surrender=True`): 56 out of 171.
# - "rsa": (`resplit_aces=True`): 50 out of 171.
#
# The casino listed with the lowest house edge is:
# "Caesars Palace; 0.26%; 6 decks; s17,ds,ls,rsa". <br/>
# This corresponds to `Rules(stand_soft17=True, resplit_aces=True)`.

# ## Table of actions for basic strategy
#
# In blackjack, **basic strategy** refers to using some optimal-action tables based on the dealer's upcard, the total of the player cards, and whether the player total is hard or soft.  The basic strategy does not consider the particular card values that contribute to the player total.

# %% [markdown]
# ### Dealer hits on soft 17 (unfavorable)
#
# Here we use the default of 6 decks.  The optimal actions exactly match those in the *basic strategy* tables shown in [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackjack#Basic_strategy).

# %% [markdown]
# ### Dealer stands on soft 17 (favorable)
#
# We now consider the case where the dealer must **stand on a soft 17**, still with the default of 6 decks.  This results in the optimal actions changing for **6 cells**, in agreement with the description in [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackjack#Basic_strategy):
#
# "only 6 cells are changed: hit on 11 vs. A, hit on 15 vs. A, stand on 17 vs. A, stand on A,7 vs. 2, stand on A,8 vs. 6, and split on 8,8 vs. A".

# ### Varying the number of decks
#
# The basic strategy varies with the number of decks, because the probability of drawing 10s or Aces changes slightly after the 3 dealt cards.

# ## Composition-dependent strategy
#
# For a small number of decks, it is slightly beneficial to consider the
# individual card values `(card1, card2)`
# rather than `(player_total, player_soft)` to determine the best action.
#
# From Wikipedia: "For example, players should ordinarily stand when holding 12 against a dealer 4. But in a single deck game, players should hit if their 12 consists of a 10 and a 2."

# ## Effect of cut-card
#
# A cut-card is often added to the shoe (e.g. 0.5 to 2.0 decks from the back), and the shoe is reshuffled after the cut-card is reached.
# There are
# [claims](https://www.blackjackincolor.com/blackjackeffects1.htm)
# that the presence of the cut-card increases the house edge.
# However, those claims seem unconvincing to me.
#
# My reasoning, which closely matches
# [this discussion](https://wizardofvegas.com/forum/gambling/blackjack/31457-cut-card-effect/),
# is that if the subset of cards in front of the cut-card has more tens than average, then the dealt hands involve fewer cards and more hands are played
# using those cards (relative to the case that the cards have fewer tens than average).
# Because hands with tens are favorable to the player, this should *reduce* the house edge.  This is a mild effect related to "card counting" but done implicitly.
